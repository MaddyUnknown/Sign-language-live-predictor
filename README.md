# Sign-language-live-predictor

Problem statement 6- The problem statement demands a means of communication between two persons, one of whom is deaf and dumb. The process requires Sign Language which is assumed to be known by the deaf and dumb person but absolutely unknown to the other. The app should aid as a translator. Whatever the normal person says must be mapped to the sign language by the app OR whatever sign the differently abled person generates must be converted into proper audio.

The system should be able to generate gestures for voice.
